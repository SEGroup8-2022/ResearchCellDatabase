# Description

This is a web-based research cell database system, created as a software engineering project. It aims to provide a simple, cross-platform, responsive frontend for interacting with a database of research papers submitted by the employees of a company.

# Overview

The database has a single table, `papers`, with the following columns:

- Employee ID
- Employee Name
- Email Address
- Paper Title
- Journal Name
- Publication Year

The interface has two modes:

- Browse: For vieweing the records
- Submit: For submitting a new record
 
A navbar at the top of the interface has links for switching between these two modes.

In browse mode, a table containing all the records is displayed to the user.

In submit mode, the user is served a form with fields corresponding the columns of the `papers` table. The user can choose to fill up and submit this form. The user input is subsequently validated, and if everything goes well, a new record should be appended to the table. The next time the user accesses browse mode, this new record will be displayed at the end.
